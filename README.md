a simulation game wherein two entities, a 'Striker' and a 'Blocker,' input sequences of six digits, each ranging from 1 to 9. The objective of the simulation is to determine whether any of the digits from the 'Striker's' sequence match those in the 'Blocker's' sequence. In case a match occurs, the simulation outcome is labeled as a 'goal.' Conversely, if no digits match, the simulation outcome is classified as 'safe'.Both striker and blocker can repeat only one digit at most twice but not back to back.
